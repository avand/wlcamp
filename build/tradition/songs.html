                  Found a chocolate cake on the kitchen shelf

                  There was a little Dutchman and is name was Dunderbeck.
                  <br />
                  He used to deal in sausages and sauerkraut and speck.
                  <br />
                  He made the finest sausages that ever you did see,
                  <br />
                  And then one day he invented a wonderful sausage machine.

                <p>

                  <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told you you&rsquo;d be sorry for inventing that machine.
                  <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now all the neighbors cats and dogs will never more be seen.
                  <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For they&rsquo;ve been ground to sausages in Dunderbeck&rsquo;s machine.

                  One day a boy came walking, came walking in   the store,
                  <br />
                  He bought a pound of sausages, and he laid them on the floor.
                  <br />
                  And the boy began to whistle, and he whistled up a tune,
                  <br />
                  And all the little sausages went dancing &rsquo;round the room.
                </p>
                <p>CHORUS</p>
                <p>
                  One day the machine go   busted, the blame thing wouldn&rsquo;t go,
                  <br />
                  So Dunderbeck he climbed inside to see what made it so.
                  <br />
                  His wife she had a nightmare, and walking in her sleep,
                  <br />
                  She gave the crank a heck of a yank, and Dunderbeck was meat!

                  In the course of our nation&rsquo;s history the people
                  of Boston have rallied bravely whenever the rights
                  of men have been threatened. Today, a new crisis has arisen.
                  The Metropolitan Transit Authority, better know as the MTA,
                  is attempting to levy a burdensome tax on the population in
                  the form of a subway fare increase.
                  Citizens, hear me out.
                  This could happen to you!!!

                    <br />
                  </em>Well, let me tell you the story of a man named Charlie
                  <br />
                  On a tragic and fateful day
                  <br />
                  He put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family
                  <br />
                  Went to ride on the MTA
                </p>
                <p>CHORUS</p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well did he ever return, no he never returned
                  <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his fate is still unlearned (what a pity)
                  <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He may ride forever &rsquo;neath the streets of Boston
                  <br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the man who never returned
                </p>
                <p>
                  Charlie handed in his dime at the Kendall Square station
                  <br />
                  And he changed for Jamaica Plain
                  <br />
                  When he got there, the conductor told him, &ldquo;One more nickle!&rdquo;
                  <br />
                  Charlie couldn&rsquo;t get off of that train.
                </p>
                <p>CHORUS (poor old Charlie)</p>
                <p>
                  Now all night long Charlie rides   through the station
                  <br />
                  Crying, &ldquo;What will become of me?&rdquo;
                  <br />
                  &ldquo;How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea?&rdquo;
                  <br />
                  &ldquo;Or my cousin in Roxbury?&ldquo;
                </p>
                <p>CHORUS (shame and scandal)</p>
                <p>
                  Charlie&rsquo;s wife goes down to the Scollay   Square station
                  <br />
                  Every day at quarter past two
                  <br />
                  And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich
                  <br />
                  As the train comes rumblin&rsquo; through
                </p>
                <p>CHORUS (he may ride forever)</p>
                <p>
                  Now you citizens of Boston don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a scandal
                  <br />
                  How the people have to pay and pay
                  <br />
                  Fight the fare increase, vote for George O&rsquo;Brian!
                  <br />
                  Get poor Charlie off the MTA!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Or else he&rsquo;ll never return, no he&rsquo;ll never return
                  <br />
                  And his fate is still unlearned (just like always)
                  <br />
                  He may ride forever &rsquo;neath the streets of Boston
                  <br />
                  He&rsquo;s the man who never returned
                  <br />
                  He&rsquo;s the man who never returned
                  <br />
