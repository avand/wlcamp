      We get loud. We get crazy. We guarantee a meal in our dining hall is like nothing
      you've ever experienced before and that once you've had a meal in our dining hall,
      you wouldn't want to do it any other way. Chants, skits, throwing giant pancakes
      through the rafters: we can list the ridiculous things we do, but it just doesn't
      do it justice! To feel the spirit of William Lawrence, you just have to be here.
      So come to the knoll this summer: you couldn't regret it if you tried.
