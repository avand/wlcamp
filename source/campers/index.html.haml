        == #{link_to 'Dining Hall', '/tour/dining-hall.html'} is like nothing
        you&rsquo;ve ever experienced before and that once you&rsquo;ve had a meal in our dining hall,
        you wouldn&rsquo;t want to do it any other way.
        == #{link_to 'Chants', '/tradition/songs.html'}, skits, throwing giant pancakes
        through the rafters; we can list the ridiculous things we do, but it just doesn&rsquo;t
        do it justice! To feel the spirit of William Lawrence, you just have to be here.
        So come to the knoll this summer: you couldn&rsquo;t regret it if you tried.

        Ever played capture the flag through the woods over a 250 acre camp?
        Are you itching to find out just what Mafia Night is? Or Counselor Hunt?
        Well you just have to wait until after dinner, when we gather for some
        of the most epic competitions that you could ever imagine. Actually,
        we dare you to think of something more epic than our E.P.&rsquo;s.
        And if you can, just let us know. We&rsquo;ll play it!

        Gold Rush is an afternoon-long event that encompasses the entirety of camp

        they get to use for carnival night, a huge end-of-session celebration
        ending in a display of fireworks.

        Everyone&rsquo;s schedule is unique because every week campers can choose the classes
        in which they will receive instruction. Below is an example of such a schedule:

          %td.description
            Once I heard the bugle, I got out of bed, put on some sweatpants and a sweatshirt.
            == Then I walked out of the #{link_to 'cabin', '/tour#cabins'} and headed for the
            == #{link_to 'Dining Hall', '/tour#dining-hall'} because today was my day to waiter.
            After I was done setting my table with my bunkmate, I played some ping-pong.

            == When the bugle rang everyone started up the #{link_to 'Knoll', '/tour#knoll'}
            and lined up on the colors line. The CQ (charge of quarters) that day was Copp cabin.
            After the flag was raised, we made our way down to the chapel for the day's password which was &ldquo;perserverance.&rdquo;

            == We all filed up to the #{link_to 'Dining Hall', '/tour#dining-hall'} for breakfast.
            The counselor in charge of calling tables announced the meal:
            &ldquo;This morning we have oatmeal, scrambled eggs, bagels, hash browns, and the breakfast bar!&rdquo;
            As the meal ended I started to help clear the table.

          %td.description
            During inspection, after I made up my own area, I swept the floor while my cabin-mates
            ==took various other jobs. Within minutes the #{link_to 'cabin', '/tour#cabins'}
            was fairly clean but it took us until the bugle to prepare it to be inspected.

            Today&rsquo;s lunch was the best! We had rib sandwiches,
            waffle fries, carrots and peas and the salad bar.
            It was fantastic! And to top it all off, we had lemon cake for desert.

            == Today I did my 4A class of #{link_to 'street hockey', '/tour#street-hockey'}.
            We started with some drills to work on stick handling and then some shooting drills
            and ended with a really fun skirmish. My team even won 3 to 2!

            == working on a qualification or down at the #{link_to 'Waterfront', '/tour#waterfront'}
            on a hot day, I decided to take it slow today and organized a game of Risk with 5 of my friends.

          %td.description
            Tonight for dinner it was pizza night! The camp cook makes the best pizza ever.
            I ended up eating 4 pieces along with a bowl of salad. Dessert was chocolate pudding.
            After my counselor dished out the pudding ,the bell rang and there was a pudding eating
            contest between two of the kitchen staff.

            After flag lowering we have about half an hour before evening program.

            The Middlers played camp-wide capture the flag. It encompassed over three acres of the camp
            including both the Junior and Middler units. I almost made it back with the other team's flag
            more than once but as the game went on I decided to be more of a defensive player.

        We would like to thank three campers who wrote a journal of their days here which was
        then edited into the above schedule. Thank you Matt Cobb, Geoff Erickson, and Will Silverman.
