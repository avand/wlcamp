      %p
        Beyond regular program we&rsquo;ve got a whole arsenal of special program days
        and activities to throw at you. Everything from Gold Rush day to leaving camp
        for an evening to see a minor league baseball game. But if you think what
        is here is the limit to our programs, you are luckily mistaken!

      %h2 Gold Rush &amp; Carnival Night

      %p
        Gold Rush is an afternoon long event that encompasses the entirety of camp
        == in a frantic search for gold. The more gold a #{link_to 'cabin', '/tour/cabins.html'} finds, the more &ldquo;money&rdquo;
        they get to use for carnival night, a huge end-of-session celebration
        ending in a display of fireworks.

      %p
        Each session, as a unit, you will get to visit the home field of one of the
        local minor league baseball teams. We often bring a unique (and by unique we mean loud)
        presence to the stadium with our camp spirit.
