      Our Waterfront has a half-mile of frontage on quiet Lower Beech Pond.
      We have a fleet of sailboats, canoes, kayaks and rowboats, a competition water-ski boat,
      a top-quality swimming area, fishing equipment and a volleyball court for those taking a break from the water.

    %p
      Come on down, sit in a drift boat by the shore, and throw a line out into the well-stocked
      waters of Lower Beech Pond. Catch a bass or a trout and our chef will cook it for your dinner!

    %h2 Swimming

    %p
      We&rsquo;ll help you work on your strokes every morning down at the waterfront,
      overseen by our red cross certified instructors. During free swim, in the afternoon,
      you&rsquo;re free to float around in tubes, splash about, or even go down our twelve-foot waterslide!
