      Our Riflery and Skeet ranges are both competition quality.
      == Located just down the hill from the #{link_to 'Farmhouse', '/tour/farmhouse.html'},
      they are easy to access and, due to their covered nature,
      are comfortable in any weather.

        Come on down to shoot some pigeons with shotguns. Clay pigeons, of course,
        but you still learn how to shoot and handle a shotgun properly. <em>Trapper ready? Pull!</em>
