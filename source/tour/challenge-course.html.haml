    %h2 Challenge Course
    
    %p
      Our Challenge Course boasts a climbing tower atop the knoll
      with stunning views, a low ropes course to build team work skills,
      as well as a top-notch high ropes course.
      We built our whole challenge course ourselves so you won’t find
      anyone who knows their course like we do ours!
