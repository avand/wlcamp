      Our registered camp nurse lives in the Infirmary all summer,
      ready to care for any and all injuries and ailments.
      == It is located at the bottom of the #{link_to 'Knoll', '/tour/knoll.html'},
      == next to the #{link_to 'Farmhouse', '/tour/farmhouse.html'}.
      We are a short 15 minute ride to the hospital should the need arise.
