      Our Barn is an important area to camp as it provides the ideal location for various #{link_to 'Evening Programs', '/campers/evening-program'} and a backup in case of inclement weather.  The Barn dates back to before the founding of the camp and is an important part of the #{link_to 'camps heritage', '/tradition/history'}. The Barn was recently refurbished as part of the Centennial Campaign to improve its flexibility and usability for the next generation of campers.
