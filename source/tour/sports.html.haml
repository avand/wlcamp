        When it comes to sports, we&rsquo;re not aiming to make you into the next
        Michael Jordan or Ronaldo; we just want you to have a ton of fun
        playing lacrosse, street hockey, or one of a dozen other sports offered,
        while learning something new about it at the same time. Everybody gets
        to play here, so if you&rsquo;re looking to learn more about a sport you&rsquo;ve
        never played before or if you&rsquo;re a seasoned pro you will have fun and,
        hopefully learn something new.
