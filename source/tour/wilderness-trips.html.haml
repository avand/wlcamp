        Glide across the scenic waters of Squam Lake, or test yourself against the rapids of the
        Androscoggin River. There is no better way to travel and experience the wilderness than by canoe.

        Even the Juniors get into the outdoors! They take a day hike up Mt. Major or Bald Knob and,
        as a cabin, they embark on a journey across the great Lower Beech Pond to stay the night
        in the camp&rsquo;s own lean-to at Perch Point. S&rsquo;mores included!
