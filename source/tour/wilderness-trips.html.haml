      Our tripping program is run out of our outcamping building
      which holds all the necessary equipment to run successful forays into the outdoors.

    %h2 Canoeing Trips

    %p
      Glide across the scenic waters of Squam Lake, or test yourself against the rapids of the
      Androscoggin River. There is no better way to travel and experience the wilderness than by canoe.

    %h2 Day Hikes

    %p
      Even the Juniors get into the outdoors! They take a day hike up Mt. Major or Bald Knob and,
      as a cabin, they embark on a journey across the great Lower Beech Pond to stay the night
      in the camp's own lean-to at Perch Point. S'mores included!
