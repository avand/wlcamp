      Some prefer to make something with their hands whether it be of pine,
      hemp, or feathers. We can teach you how to do much more than just the
      traditional arts and crafts, such as fly tying and wood working.

      Hemp, necklaces, gimp, kites, and much more are available for anyone
      to make in the arts and crafts room. But, if stationary crafts are
      not your cup of tea, you can build your own model rocket and launch it far above the trees!
