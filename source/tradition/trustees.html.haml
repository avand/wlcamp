    %h2 Board of Trustees

    %p
      The Board of Trustees is a concerned, active group of individuals close to
      the camp who meet at least four times a year to set policy, review operations,
      and, with the help of the Director, steer the course of the Camp.
    %p
      The Board of Trustees and Members of the Corporation have all had a close
      association with William Lawrence for many years: many were campers themselves,
      and still more are the parents of current and former campers and staff members.
