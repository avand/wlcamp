    %h2 Why William Lawrence Camp?

    %p
      William Lawrence Camp is an independent, not-for-profit organization;
      our entire focus is on providing an extraordinary experience for your child
      that will benefit him for years to come. We believe that the best way for boys
      to learn is through being active, especially while surrounded by natural beauty.
      Our well-balanced program offers instruction in diverse activities, such as Archery,
      Waterskiing, and Wilderness Trips, that your child would likely not be able to
      participate in at home. And, as a small camp, we do not experience the bottlenecks
      at popular activities that larger camps are rife with: if your child is interested
      in an activity, they will be able to do it. As well, our better than 3-to-1 camper
      to staff ratio ensures that your child will be well looked after.

      All capital improvements at William Lawrence are paid for by donations,
      which are tax deductible as we are a 501(c)3. This, among other benefits of being
      not-for-profit, means we can provide higher-quality facilities without passing
      the cost on in our tuition. When you send your child to William Lawrence Camp,
      you are not merely providing them entertainment for the summer:
      you are introducing them to the William Lawrence Camp Family,
      a supportive community of individuals dedicated to camp and to each other.

    %p
      William Lawrence is a high-quality, reasonably-priced organization that
      prepares boys for their futures as men.
