    %h2 Family Camp

    %p
      Just because traditional camp ends, it doesn&rsquo;t mean camp is over:
      come on back with the whole family! Every year in August we open up camp
      for families to stay in cabins themselves, so everybody can get the camp experience.
    %p
      We&rsquo;ll have all the activities of regular camp open &mdash; you can jump in as a whole family,
      or children can hang out in Kid&rsquo;s Camp while the adults can get their own camp experience.
      No matter what you choose to do, you can be sure to refuel at each meal on our healthy,
      == delicious food offerings. Each #{link_to 'meal', '/tour/dining-hall.html'} has fruit and vegetarian options,
      and we have a full salad bar for lunch and dinner.
    %p
      Come to William Lawrence and let your family become a part of ours.
